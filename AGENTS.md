# Agent Rules

These rules apply to every task in this project unless explicitly overridden.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work. Use judgment on trivial tasks.

## Rule 1 — Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask rather than guess.
Present multiple interpretations when ambiguity exists.
Push back when a simpler approach exists.
Stop when confused. Name what's unclear.

## Rule 2 — Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code.
Test: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## Rule 3 — Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.

## Rule 4 — Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Don't follow steps. Define success and iterate.
Strong success criteria let you loop independently.

## Rule 5 — Read Before You Write
Before adding code in a file, read the file's exports, the immediate caller, and any obvious shared utilities.
If you don't understand why existing code is structured the way it is, ask before adding to it.
"Looks orthogonal to me" is the most dangerous phrase in this codebase.

## Rule 6 — Tests Verify Intent, Not Just Behavior
Every test must encode WHY the behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test like `expect(getUserName()).toBe('John')` is worthless if the function takes a hardcoded ID.
If you can't write a test that would fail when business logic changes, the function is wrong.

## Rule 7 — Checkpoint After Every Significant Step
After completing each step in a multi-step task: summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back to me.
If you lose track, stop and restate.
